#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 2

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, the project created in Part 1 is further enhanced and improved on to increase performance, accessibility and PWA scores.

### Specification

Earlier in part 1, the data was served through a hard coded json file restaurant.json, which in Part 2 will no longer be used. Instead a development server is deployed which serves the data. The code must access this data for the website. Indexed DB will store the data that is fetched and then serve if database has it else it will get from the api itself. Lastly, the lighthouse scores are worked on to improve. Manifest.json, applying PWA to all pages, improving accessibilty improves these scores.
